What's new in Kwant 1.5
=======================

This article explains the user-visible changes in Kwant 1.5.0.

Improved tutorial building
--------------------------
Improving or adding to Kwant's tutorial is now much simpler. Now
the text and code for each tutorial is kept in the same file, making
it easy to see where changes need to be made, and images generated by
the code are inserted directly into the document thanks to the magic of
`jupyter-sphinx <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/jupyter-sphinx/>`_.
It has never been easier to get started contributing to Kwant by
helping us improve our documentation.
